        <p>
            I am currently an Immigration Legal Assistant looking for a change in careers. 
            Coding has been something I have been interested in but never had the opportunity to dive in like I am doing so now.
            It has become a past time that I enjoy doing on the days that I am not out hiking or spending time with family.
            I hope to do more with my coding in the future and make a career out of it.
